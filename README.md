# Coursera-Wikipedia-Big-Data-Project
The data of the project can be downloaded from here:
http://alaska.epfl.ch/~dockermoocs/bigdata/wikipedia.dat

This project uses full-text data from Wikipedia to produce a rudimentary metric of how popular a programming language is, in an effort to see if our Wikipedia-based rankings bear any relation to the popular Red Monk rankings.
